              Twitter, Inc. (“Twitter”) and Facebook, Inc. (“Facebook”)
              (collectively, “Third Party Analytics Services”) to analyze how

              >Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows
              you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and
              services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do
              not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities
              over time and across different websites. Our Services do not
              support Do Not Track requests at this time.<br /><br /><strong
                >HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION (LEGAL BASIS)?<br />‍</strong
              >Digital Base uses personal information to provide our Services to
              you (including to improve and personalize our Services), to
              process your transactions, to communicate with you, for security
              and fraud prevention, and to comply with various laws and
              regulations. Digital Base uses your personal information only when
              we have a valid legal basis to do so. The following shows you the
              legal basis for the various ways in which we process your personal
              information:<br />‍<br /><strong
                >Contractual Necessity<br />‍</strong
              >Contractual necessity means that we need to process your personal
              information in order to provide you with Services you have
              requested.&nbsp; Personal information we process under the legal
              basis of contractual necessity include:<br />‍<br />Contact data
              (e.g., name, address, email, phone number)<br />Profile data
              (e.g., age, birthday)<br />Account data (e.g., phone number<br />)Device
              data (e.g., device ID)<br />IP addressLocation data<br />Analytics
              data<br />Video metadata<br />Videos<br />Photos<br />Legitimate
              Business Interest<br />Sometimes we process your personal
              information to further the legitimate business interests of
              Digital Base or a third-party. Legitimate business interests means
              that processing your personal information is an important part of
              Digital Base operating its business and providing Services to you.
              Examples of these legitimate business interests include:<br />‍<br />Operation
              and improvement of our business, products, and services<br />Marketing
              of our products and services<br />Provision of customer support<br />Protection
              from fraud or security threats<br />Compliance with legal
              obligations<br />Completion of corporate transactions<br />Personal
              information that we process under the legal basis of legitimate
              business interests includes:<br />‍<br />Contact data (e.g., name,
              address, email, phone number, personal and/or company social media
              accounts)<br />Profile data (e.g., school, clothing size)<br />Account

              (e.g., IP address)<br />Videos<br />Consent<br />‍<br />In some
              cases, we process your personal information only after you have
              given us consent to do so, such as when we conduct certain
              marketing activities. You are always free not to provide consent,
              or to withdraw your consent at any time after it has been given.
              &nbsp;<br />‍<br /><strong>Other Processing Grounds<br />‍</strong
              >From time to time, although it is very rare, we may also need to
              process your personal information to comply with a legal
              obligation, if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of
              you or other individuals, or if it is necessary for a task carried
              out in the public interest.<br />Digital Base retains personal
              information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes
              for which it was collected, including as described in this Privacy
              Policy, or as required by law.<br />‍<br /><strong
                >WILL DIGITAL BASE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION?<br />‍</strong
              >We may share your personal information with third-parties that
              help us provide Services and do business. These third-parties
              include:<br />Advertisers: We may allow advertisers and/or
              merchant partners (“Advertisers”) to choose the demographic
              information of users who will see their advertisements and/or
              promotional offers.&nbsp; You agree that we may provide any of the
              information we have collected from you in non-personally
              identifiable form to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser
              to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or
              offers. For example, we might use the fact you are located in New
              York to show you ads or offers for New York businesses, but we
              will not tell such businesses who you are. Or, we might allow
              Advertisers to display their ads to users with similar usage
              patterns to yours, but we will not disclose usage information to
              Advertisers except in aggregate form, and not in a manner that
              would identify you personally.&nbsp; Note that if an advertiser
              asks us to show an ad to a certain audience or audience segment
              and you respond to that ad, the advertiser may conclude that you
              fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.<br />‍<br />We
              may deliver a file to you through the Services (known as a “web
              beacon”) from an ad network. Web beacons allow ad networks to
              provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting
              for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to
              serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other
              websites. Because your web browser must request these
              advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers,
              these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as
              if you had requested a web page from their site. You may be able
              to opt-out of web beacon tracking conducted by third-parties
              through our Services by adjusting the Do Not Track settings on
              your browser. Please note that we don’t control whether or how
              these third parties comply with Do Not Track requests.<br />‍<br />Affiliated
              Businesses: In certain situations, businesses or third-party
              websites we are affiliated with may sell or provide products or
              services to you through or in connection with the Services (either
              alone or jointly with us).&nbsp; You can recognize when an
              affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or
              service, and we will share your personal information with that
              affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such
              transaction or Service. We have no control over the policies and
              practices of third-party websites or businesses as to privacy or
              anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or
              service relating to an affiliated website or business, please
              review all such business’ or websites’ policies.<br />‍<br />Service
              Providers: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks
              on our behalf and need to share your information with them to
              provide products or Services to you. Unless we tell you
              differently, our service providers do not have any right to use
              the personal information we share with them beyond what is
